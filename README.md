# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
Due to evidence of academic dishonesty on the reading and math scores for Thomas High School ninth graders, the PyCitySchools reports previously generated for the District must be modified. In this analysis, the reading and math scores for Thomas High School ninth graders have been invalidated to uphold state-testing standards. A new Distric and Schools Analysis have been conducted to reflect the clean data and describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.

#### Observations
- The ninth graders at Thomas High School represent a small percentage of the total count of students in the District. Therefore, the District totals have been slightly affected.

### 2. School Summary

#### Before 9th grade scores were invalidated

- Once the metrics for the school summary were calculated with the invalid 9th graders scores, Thomas High School's overall passing percentage dropped significantly. The school went from having an overall passing rate of 90.9% to a 65%.
- In order to reflect a more accurate passing rate, I used the data from 10th through 12th graders to recalculate the passing math, passing reading, and overall passing percentages. The image below shows this analysis.
